  <p>Do I actually like <a href="roam-research">Roam Research</a>?<br />
    - It is pretty simple<br />
        - Quick writing experience<br />
        - Quick <a href="linking">Linking</a><br />
    - However, I'm not sure about the outlining<br />
        - Want to have everything contained in the knowledge database. That includes longer form tasks/exams/essays<br />
    - I'm also not sure about <a href="connor-white-sullivan">Connor White Sullivan</a> and having all my knowledge stored on <a href="roam-research">Roam Research</a>'s database.</p>

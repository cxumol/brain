<blockquote>
  <p>In physics, action is an attribute of the dynamics of a physical system from which the equations of motion of the system can be derived through the principle of stationary action. Action is a mathematical functional which takes the trajectory, also called path or history, of the system as its argument and has a real number as its result. Generally, the action takes different values for different paths.</p>

<p>Mathematical formulation via the <a href="lagrangian">Lagrangian</a>:</p>

<p>$$S=\int dt L(q,\dot q)$$</p>

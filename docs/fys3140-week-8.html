    - Homogeneous equations are equations of the form<br />
        - $y'' + P(x)y' + Q(x)y = 0$<br />
        - Always a solution as a linear combination of two solutions<br />
            - "The general solution is a linear combination of two linearly independent solutions, $c<em>1y</em>1(x) +c<em>2y</em>2(x)$. The solution is uniquely fixed if $y(x<em>0)$ and $yâ€²(x</em>0)$ are specified."<br />
        - Uniquely fixed by the boundary conditions $y(x<em>0)$ and $y'(x</em>0)$.<br />
        - Constant coefficients<br />
            - General solution of the form $e^{\lambda x}$.<br />
            - Found from the quadratic equation for $\lambda$.</p>

Recall the [[Quantization]] a la [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]] with the following properties:

- Relativistic energy-momentum (requirement of [[Special relativity]])
- Number $N$ of particles is conserved

But using these two, we encounter a number of paradoxes:

1. The very concept of a particle seems to be shattered, because the [[Relativistic energy-momentum relation]] combined with the [[Unceirtanty principle]], seems to say that we cannot require that the number of particles is conserved.
2. [[Causality]] is violated
3. There should exist [[Negative energy|negative energy states]]
4. We have no explanation of [[Spin]], but it suddenly appears
5. The [[Probability interpretation]] cannot be explained anymore

In this course we will see what happens if we give up one the assumption that the "number $N$ of particles is conserved", i.e.

> Construct a multiparticle ($N$ not conserved) "field" theory

## 1. Classical field theory

### [[Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian]]

We have a point particle in 1D:

- It has the [[Action (physics)|action]] - $S=\int dt L(q,\dot q)$ - which is only dependent on the [[Phase space]] variables [[Position]] and [[Velocity]]. Minimizing this "trajectory" through [[Phase space]] leads to the [[Lagrange's equation|equations of motion]].

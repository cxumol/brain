Recall the [[Quantization]] a la [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]] with the following properties:

- Relativistic energy-momentum (requirement of [[Special relativity]])
- Number $N$ of particles is conserved

But using these two, we encounter a number of paradoxes:

1. The very concept of a particle seems to be shattered, because the [[Relativistic energy-momentum relation]] combined with the [[Unceirtanty principle]], seems to say that we cannot require that the number of particles is conserved.
2. [[Causality]] is violated
3. There should exist [[Negative energy|negative energy states]]
4. We have no explanation of [[Spin]], but it suddenly appears
5. The [[Probability interpretation]] cannot be explained anymore

In this course we will see what happens if we give up one the assumption that the "number $N$ of particles is conserved", i.e.

> Construct a multiparticle ($N$ not conserved) "field" theory

## 1. Classical field theory

### [[Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian]]

We have a point particle in 1D:

- It has the [[Action (physics)|action]] - $S=\int dt L(q,\dot q)$ - which is only dependent on the [[Phase space]] variables [[Position]] and [[Velocity]]. Minimizing this "trajectory" through [[Phase space]] leads to the [[Lagrange's equation|equations of motion]].

Now lets consider 1D $\rightarrow$ $N$ dimensions. Now $q\rightarrow q = (q_1,...,q_N)$ and $\dot q = \frac{d}{dt}q$. However, our goal is not to consider a situation with $N$ [[Degrees of freedom|d.o.f.]], but a situation with infinite [[Degrees of freedom|d.o.f.'s]]. 

This is where [[Field theory]] comes in. It considers a [[Lagrangian density]] instead (required by [[Locality]]!). Now our [[Action (physics)|action]] is written:

$$S = \int dtL = \int d^4x\mathcal L(\phi, \partial_\mu \phi ),$$

where $\mathcal L$ is the mentioned [[Lagrangian density]] (or just the [[Lagrangian]], if you must). $\phi(x^\mu)$ is a [[Field (physics)|field]].

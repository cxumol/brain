The **bias-variance tradeoff** is the property where a predictive model with a *low [[Bias of estimators|bias]]* has a *higher [[Variance|variance]]* and vice versa. 

- High [[Bias of estimators|bias]] can cause a model to miss important relations between features and target outputs.
- High [[Variance|variance]] can lead to the random noise of the [[Training set|training set]] to be modeled, namely [[Overfitting|overfitting]].

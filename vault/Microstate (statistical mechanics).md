A **microstate** is a specific configuration of a thermodynamical system at the microscopic level. This is in contrast with a *[[Macrostate (statistical mechanics)|macrostate]]*, which refers to properties like [[Temperature|temperature]], [[Pressure|pressure]], [[Volume|volume]] or [[Density|density]]. We can often specify a microstate as the vector of the state of each of the $N$ elements in the system $(q_1,...,q_N)$, where the $q_i$'s are the properties measured for the $i$th element.

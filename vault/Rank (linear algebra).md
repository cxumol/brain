The **rank** of a matrix $A$ is the [[Dimension|dimension]] of the [[Vector space|vector space]] spanned by either the *columns* or the *rows*. This is directly correspondent to the number of [[Linear independence|linearly independent]] column/row vectors of $A$. The common practice is to denote the rank as:

$$ \text{rank}(A) $$

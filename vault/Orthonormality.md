Two vectors are **orthonormal** if they are [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] and their inner product with themself equals $1$. 

More formally defined, we picture an [[Inner product space|inner product space]] $\mathcal V$ containing a set of $n$ vectors $\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\} \in \mathcal V$. This set of vectors is **orthonormal** [[iff]]

$$ \forall\ i,j:\langle v_i, v_j\rangle = \delta_{ij}, $$

where $\delta_{ij}$ is the [[Kroenecker delta]] and $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle$ is the [[Inner product|inner product]] defined in $\mathcal V$.

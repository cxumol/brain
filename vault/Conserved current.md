Also called the **Noether current**, is a current $j_N^\mu$ that satisfies the [[Continuity equation|equation]]:

$$\partial_\mu J_N^\mu = 0$$

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_current):

> Indeed, integrating the [[Continuity equation|continuity equation]] over a volume $V$, large enough to have no net currents through its surface, leads to the conservation law:
> 
> $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}Q = 0,$$
> 
> where $Q = \int_V j^0 dV$ is the [[Conserved charge|conserved quantity]]

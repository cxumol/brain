## Hardware

I currently use a [[Lenovo]] Yoga S730 with these specs:

- **CPU**: [[Intel]] i7-8565U 8 core 4.6GHz (In other words, plenty of compiling power.)
- **Memory**: 16 GB LPDDR3
- **Storage**: 512 GB SSD
- **Screen**: 13.3" 1920x1080 (I don't do any video/photo editing, so this is plenty sharp enough. It has great contrast and is comfortable to use for coding.)

I've so far been very happy with it, as it is extremely portable, but still powerful. It also helps that the keyboard is *incredible*!

## Software

On my Lenovo I run [[Arch Linux]]. Here is my current setup:

- **[[Desktop Environment|DE]]**: [[KDE Plasma]]
- **Browser**: [[Firefox]]
- **Terminal emulator**: [[Alacritty]]
- **Shell**: [[mksh]]
- **Text editor**: [[Visual Studio Code]] with embedded [[Neovim]]

> I've changed from an extremely minlmal install ([[Artix Linux]] with [[sowm]]) to the one described above, as I've experienced a more fully-fledged modern [[Desktop Environment|DE]] makes my daily life much simpler. Running [[Artix Linux|Artix]] and customizing almost everything myself was a great learning experience, but not efficient enough for daily use. Also, [[systemd]] - however bloated it might be - is used by a lot of software and services which I depend on.

I try my best to run a strict file system structure, which I describe [[My file system structure|here]].

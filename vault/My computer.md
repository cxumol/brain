## Hardware

I currently use a [[Lenovo]] Yoga S730 with these specs:

- **CPU**: [[Intel]] i7-8565U 8 core 4.6GHz (In other words, plenty of compiling power.)
- **Memory**: 16 GB LPDDR3
- **Storage**: 512 GB SSD
- **Screen**: 13.3" 1920x1080 (I don't do any video/photo editing, so this is plenty sharp enough. It has great contrast and is comfortable to use for coding.)

I've so far been very happy with it, as it is extremely portable, but still powerful. It also helps that the keyboard is *incredible*!

## Software

On my Lenovo I run [[Artix Linux]] (with [[runit]] as the init system). Here is my current setup:

- **[[Window manager|WM]]**: [[sowm]]
- **Browser**: [[Firefox]]
- **Terminal emulator**: [[Alacritty]]
- **Shell**: [[mksh]]
- **Text editor**: [[Neovim]]
- **Notifications**: [[Dunst]]
- **Theming**: [[Pywal]]

> I am currently changing over to [[Arch Linux]] and [[KDE Plasma]], as these will make daily life much simpler. Running [[Artix Linux|Artix]] and customizing most of the DE myself was a great learning experience, but not efficient enough for daily use. Also, [[systemd]] - however bloated it might be - is used by a lot of software and services which I depend on.

I try my best to run a strict file system structure, which I describe [[My file system structure|here]].

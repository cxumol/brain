## Hardware

I currently use a [[Lenovo]] Yoga S730 with these specs:

- **CPU**: [[Intel]] i7-8565U 8 core 4.6GHz (In other words, plenty of compiling power.)
- **Memory**: 16 GB LPDDR3
- **Storage**: 512 GB SSD
- **Screen**: 13.3" 1920x1080 (I don't do any video/photo editing, so this is plenty sharp enough. It has great contrast and is comfortable to use for coding.)

I've so far been very happy with it, as it is extremely portable, but still powerful. It also helps that the keyboard is *incredible*!

## Software

On my Lenovo I run [[Artix Linux]] (with [[runit]] as the init system) in dual boot with [[Windows 10]]. I rarely use [[Windows 10|Windows]], but keep it because of [[FL Studio]]. Here is my current setup

- **[[Window manager|WM]]**: [[bspwm]]
- **Bar**: [[Polybar]]
- **Browser**: [[Firefox]]
- **Terminal emulator**: [[Termite (terminal)|Termite]]
- **Shell**: [[friendly interactive shell|fish]]
- **Text editor**: [[Neovim]]
- **Notifications**: [[Dunst]]
- **Theming**: [[Pywal]]

**Neovim** is an extension of the text editor [[Vim]], implementing modern technologies like - most importantly - [[Asynchrony|asynchrony]].

Neovim also aims to clean the codebase and implement saner defaults to increase usability for newer users. It is scriptable with [[Lua]] and version 0.5 implements my absolute favorite feature of all time: Built-in [[Language Server Protocol|LSP]] support. You really didn't know you needed this until you have it, so please do yourself a favor and read up on [the documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html).

If you want a look at my dotfiles, they are hosted [here on SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~kmaasrud/dotfiles/tree/master/item/.config/nvim)

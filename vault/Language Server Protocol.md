The **Language Server Protocol** or **LSP** is a [[JSON]]-based protocol initially developed for [[Visual Studio Code]]. It's goal is to define a standard protocol for communication between a text editor or an IDE, and a server providing information about the targeted programming language. This allows the editors or IDEs to provide support for a wide range of programming languages without explicitly programming it for each one - essentially turning an $a\times b$ problem into an $a+b$ problem.

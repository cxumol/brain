(I probably know most of this from the previous year, but here are a couple of short notes.)

## Relaxation to [[Thermal equilibrium|equilibrium]] by [[Diffusion|diffusion]]

### Macroscopic explanation

There's a net transport of either *energy* or *particles* until a [[Thermal equilibrium]] is reached. This is somewhat unexplained in the macroscopic scale. There is, for example, a [[Proportionality|proportionality rule]] between the [[Gradient|gradient]] of concentration/temperature and the corresponding flux:

- $\vec J =-D\nabla c$
- $\vec Q = -\lambda \nabla T$

### Microscopic explanation

There's a net transportation of *energy* or *particles* via random thermal motion and particle collisions, which eventually makes the system reach equilibrium. 

## Models of [[Diffusion|diffusion]]

- Molecular dynamics
- [[Random walk]]
- [[Algorithmic model of diffusion|Algorithmic]]
- [[Ideal gas]]

## [[Equipartition theorem]]

The [[Equipartition theorem]] reads:

> At equilibrium with temperature $T$, any quadratic form of the [[Internal energy|internal energy]] is $\frac{1}{2}k_BT$ per degree of freedom

In an [[Ideal gas]] with $N$ particles, this gives

$$U = \frac{f}{2}NkT$$

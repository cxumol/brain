Here I am testing converting [[links]]. Does it work? What about [[links|aliased links]]? And finally, how about [[links#header links]]? Or maybe several [[links#more header links]].

Here is a [[links#header link with .]], which I know Hugo isn't happy with.

Okay say another link [[links#Some header]]

Here is ==highlight==. ![[Pasted image.png]]

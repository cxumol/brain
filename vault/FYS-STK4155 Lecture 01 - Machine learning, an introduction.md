Difference between:

- [[Supervised learning]]: We know the answer to the problem, and the computer finds logic based on learning from these answers.
- [[Unsupervised learning]]: We don't know the answers, and the computer has to find patterns and relationships to solve the problem itself.

## Essential elements of [[Machine learning]]

The methods we cover have three main topics in common:

- **Our data set**: One of the most important parts of [[Machine learning]] is to set up your data in a meaningful way.
- **Our model**: Normally a function of some parameters. It reflects our knowledge of the system.
- **A cost/loss function**: This allows us to present an estimate on how good our model is in reproducing the data it is supposed to train on.

So at the heart of most [[Machine learning]] problems, there is a minimization/optimization problem.

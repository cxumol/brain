[[pywal]] is pretty darn awesome. I need it integrated everywhere. There should be some way of fetching the colors generated to [[Xresources]] and use them in [[CSS]] files for example (I'm thinking [[userChrome]] for [[Firefox]] or [[Obsidian]] theming). I will probably have to do this through some kind of [[Shell script]] or [[Python]] script.

Yes, its possible! [[pywal]] generates a [[CSS]] file containing the generated colors, so a simple [[CSS import|import]] solves this issue. Although [[Obsidian]] has some sort of security measure on their app which blocks importing external css files.

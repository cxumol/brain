The **standard deviation** is a measure of how much a set of values varies from the [[Expected value (statistics)|expected value or mean]] $\mu$.

## Discrete case

Given a set of measured values, the standard deviation is

$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2}, $$

where $\mu$ is the [[Mean|mean]] of the set.

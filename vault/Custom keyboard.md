This is my WIP recipe for a custom keyboard build:

I've settled on a 65%, since I most likely will use the arrow keys. An alternative could be going 60% and ditching the arrow keys for a more minimal aesthetic. I don't think this'll be as comfortable though, and might make a 40% at a later date for compact usage.

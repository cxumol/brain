The **Akaike information criterion** (AIC) is an [[Estimator|estimator]] of out-of-sample prediction error, and thus a measure of quality of statistical models, for a given set of data. Its defenition is

$$ \text{AIC} = 2d - 2\text{loglik} ,$$

where $d$ is the number of parameters estimated by the model and $\text{loglik}$ is the log of the maximized [[Likelihood function|likelihood function]].

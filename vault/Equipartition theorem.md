The basic principle behind the **equipartition theorem** is that in [[Thermal equilibrium]], the energy is shared equally among its various forms. More directly, linking this to temperature, it says that at [[Thermal equilibrium|equilibrium]], any quadratic form of the internal energy is $\frac{1}{2} k_BT$ per [[Degree of freedom|degree of freedom]], $k_B$ being the [[Boltzmann constant]].

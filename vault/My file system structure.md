I try my best to run a strict structure for my file system. This ensures consistency and decreases the mental effort required when navigating my computer. My user directory is organized the following way (excluding hidden directories):

- `brain` - This is the directory containg everything you're reading now. Simply put, this is where I put my notes, but it also emobodies the system which I use to organize, connect and publish them.
-  `dev` - This is the location of all the repositories I need on my computer at the present moment. I try keep it clean by regularly removing repos I no longer need on my physical drive. Everything here is [[Version control system|version controlled]] through [[Git]] (or similar), and uploaded to the cloud.
-  `dl` - This is simply my downloads folder. All downloaded files end up here, and it works both as an inbox and a temporary work directory.
-  `doc` - Documents related to school, books or similar get put here.
-  `mus` - Music and audio get placed here. This can be my personal music library (I mostly use [[Spotify]] though), [[Grytidlig]] related files or files related to music production.
-  `pic` - Pictures get placed here, though I rarely keep pictures on my physical drive.
-  `vid` - Videos - series and movies - get placed here, though I rarely keep them on my physical drive.

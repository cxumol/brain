As mentioned in the end of [[FYS2160 Lecture 05 - Multiplicity of Einstein crystal, multiplicity limit and Stirling approximation#Multiplicity of coupled Einstein crystals|the last lecture]], a system will always develop towards the most likely [[Macrostate (statistical mechanics)|macrostate]] - namely, the [[Macrostate (statistical mechanics)|macrostate]] with the highest [[Multiplicity|multiplicity]]. The final state is called the **[[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium state]]** of the system.

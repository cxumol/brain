- [[FYS3140 Week 8 Highlights of last week]]
    - Homogeneous equations are equations of the form
        - $y'' + P(x)y' + Q(x)y = 0$
        - Always a solution as a linear combination of two solutions
            - "The general solution is a linear combination of two linearly independent solutions, $c_1y_1(x) +c_2y_2(x)$. The solution is uniquely fixed if $y(x_0)$ and $yâ€²(x_0)$ are specified."
        - Uniquely fixed by the boundary conditions $y(x_0)$ and $y'(x_0)$. 
        - Constant coefficients
            - General solution of the form $e^{\lambda x}$.
            - Found from the quadratic equation for $\lambda$.

Ordinary differential equations (DEs)
    - Second order DEs:
        - $$y′′+P(x)y′+Q(x)y=R(x)$$.
    - Homogeneous:
        - $$R(x) = 0$$.
        - The general solution is a linear combination of two linearly independent solutions, $$c_1y_1(x) +c_2y_2(x)$$. The solution is uniquely fixed if $$y(x_0)$$ and $$y′(x_0)$$ are specified.
        - If one solution $$y_1(x)$$ of the homogeneous DE is known, a second, linearly independent one, can be found by variation of constants, $$y_2(x) =c(x)y_1(x)$$.  This ansatz will lead to a firstorder DE for $$c′(x)$$, to be solved by integrating factors.
- Ordinary differential equations - homogeneous case
    - Homogeneous DEs with constant coefficients:  General solution of the form $$e^{\lambda x}$$.  Get a quadratic characteristic equation for $$\lambda$$.  Roots can be real or complex.  In the case of double roots, variation of constants gives $$y(x) = (A+Bx)e^{\lambda x}$$.

        <p>Here you will find all of my notes and a lot of my schoolwork, all together forming some form of densely interlinked personal <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. Feel free to explore my brain as you please, but beware that most notes are for personal use, and may thus be confusing for others.</p>

        <p>I'm working on implementing <a href="https://www.kmaasrud.com/brain/searching-my-brain">search</a>, as well as some sort of index, but for now you'll just have to follow the hyperlinks. A natural place to start could be to look at <a href="https://www.kmaasrud.com/brain/my-computer">my computer</a>.</p>

Okay, I've switched to [[Obsidian.md]]. Feels weird, but I think local storage is the best.

Should I move to [[Vim]] keys?
- The focus on writing and not neccesarily editing makes me think no
- I'm getting pretty confident though, so maybe I'll be faster?

Does Roam-style aliases work? Apparently not...

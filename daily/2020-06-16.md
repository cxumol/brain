Do I actually like [[Roam Research]]?
    - It is pretty simple
        - Quick writing experience
        - Quick [[Linking]]
    - However, I'm not sure about the outlining
        - Want to have everything contained in the knowledge database. That includes longer form tasks/exams/essays
    - I'm also not sure about [[Connor White Sullivan]] and having all my knowledge stored on [[Roam Research]]'s database.

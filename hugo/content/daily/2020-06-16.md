Do I actually like [Roam Research]({{< ref "Roam Research.md" >}})?
    - It is pretty simple
        - Quick writing experience
        - Quick [Linking]({{< ref "Linking.md" >}})
    - However, I'm not sure about the outlining
        - Want to have everything contained in the knowledge database. That includes longer form tasks/exams/essays
    - I'm also not sure about [Connor White Sullivan]({{< ref "Connor White Sullivan.md" >}}) and having all my knowledge stored on [Roam Research]({{< ref "Roam Research.md" >}})'s database.

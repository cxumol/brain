Okay, I've switched to [Obsidian]({{< ref "Obsidian.md" >}}). Feels weird, but I think local storage is the best.

Should I move to [Vim]({{< ref "Vim.md" >}}) keys?
- The focus on writing and not neccesarily editing makes me think no
- I'm getting pretty confident though, so maybe I'll be faster?

Does Roam-style aliases work? Apparently not...

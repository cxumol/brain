Here I am testing converting [links]({{< ref "links.md" >}}). Does it work? What about [aliased links]({{< ref "links.md" >}})? And finally, how about [header links]({{< ref "links.md#header-links" >}})? Or maybe several [more header links]({{< ref "links.md#more-header-links" >}}).

Here is a [header link with .]({{< ref "links.md#header-link-with-dot" >}}), which I know Hugo isn't happy with.

Okay say another link [Some header]({{< ref "links.md#Some-header" >}})

This energy is known as the <a href="ground-state-energy">zero-point energy</a>, and an excited state is any state with an energy greater than the ground state. If several ground states exist with (i.e. they hav the same lowest energy), they are described as being <a href="degeneracy">degenerate</a>.</p>
